## 6. **Special Feature:** Ultra fast task adding methods.

After typing the task name, press **ENTER** *button* to add the task.

## **Auto-focus** and **input field reset**.

To make adding multiple tasks *faster* and *easier*, automatic selection of an input field has been added. This means that each time you **add a new task**, the **input field selects automatically** and **input field text clears**. 

You can quickly *enter multiple tasks* one by one, without having to select an input field and clearing field after each task is added.

To make this work *submit a new task* with the **ENTER** *key*.
